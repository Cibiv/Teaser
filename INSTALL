To install Teaser, use the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Cibiv/Teaser.git
cd Teaser
./install.py

Important: Teaser requires an internet connection during installation in order to download the mappers.

To test if everything works, we suggest running an example benchmark:

./teaser.py example_ecoli.yaml

The results for the benchmark can afterwards be found in the reports directory.
