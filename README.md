#Teaser
Welcome to the official Github page of Teaser, an analytical framework for benchmarking NGS read mappers. Teaser allows researchers to identify the optimal mapper, parameter set and mapping quality thresholds for data sets that mimic their real data. Teaser is easy-to-use, flexible and fast thanks to its genome subsampling process, allowing users to test a variety of scenarios within minutes. Teaser is available as [web application](http://teaser.cibiv.univie.ac.at), a [virtual machine image](https://github.com/Cibiv/Teaser#advanced-users-virtual-machine-image) and as [installable version](https://github.com/Cibiv/Teaser#advanced-users-installation).

##Documentation
For information on how to start benchmarking mappers with Teaser, as well as all advanced topics check out our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Cibiv/Teaser/wiki).
